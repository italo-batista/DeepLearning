# DeepLearning

This repository keeps track of my awesome adventure trying
to know a little more about deep learning (mainly with TensorFlow :smile:).



## What can you find here?

* Links to my personal projects while learning Deep Learning and Tensorflow
* Links for online resources to get started with Deep Learning and TensorFlow
